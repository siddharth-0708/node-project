    GIT STEPS:
    step one: choose the direcotry where u need to have version control.In our case it is files of web-server
    step two: from bash, give git init.It will generate a git repository in that direcotry.so web-server is ur 
    master and all files inside it will be kept track.
    step3: You can see .git folder getting generated.That will keep all the changes.It is not visible usually but
    you can enable in settings
    step4: Go to github and create repository with any name.Not neccessary to have the same name as master folder.
    step 5: In master, $ git remote add origin https://github.com/siddharth-0708/node-project.git . this will add npde-project
    in github as origine where all the web-server files will be pushed and tracked.
    $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/siddharth-0708/node-project.git to use command git pull upstream master
    $ git push --set- https://github.com/siddharth-0708/node-project.git to just use push

    $ git push heroku master
    To https://git.heroku.com/siddharth0708-weather.git
    https://siddharth0708-weather.herokuapp.com/ deployed to Heroku

    note: From now on GIT has removed the word master.So now if u generate new git, rename it with main and use pull upstream main $ git branch -m main master
